### Routing Input with `withComponentInputBinding()` 

Next and last topic is related to routing and input binding that enables 
params from url to be retrived via input in component. 
So, in simple words it's combination of routing params and input binding that you've
read already in this article. It's a modern approach that is available in Angular v17+.

| ❌     | Overusing withComponentInputBinding() for communication can clutter the routing configuration by making it more complex and difficult to manage. Each time data needs to be passed between components, the route definition must include the necessary input bindings. As the application grows, this can lead to a routing configuration filled with many input bindings for different components, making the routing file harder to read and maintain.                               |
| ❌     | ??? Only works with routes, limiting its use for other types of component interactions. |
| ❌     | Not ideal for handling complex logic or real-time data updates.                         |
| ❌     | Supports one-way data binding only, requiring extra steps for two-way communication.    |
| ✅     | Cleaner, centralized logic in route config for easier maintenance.                      |
| ✅     | Enables decoupled communication between components through routes.                      |
| ✅     | Directly binds route data to component inputs, reducing extra code.                     |
