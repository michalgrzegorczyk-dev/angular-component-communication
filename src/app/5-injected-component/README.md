### 5. Injected Components

<img src="/public/img/injected-components.png" alt="x" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">

Injecting components is rarely used technique and personally, I haven't
seen that, but it's great discover to elaborate. It allows a child component to 
access its parent component directly. This method provides a way to 
establish communication between components in a parent-child 
relationship. What you need to do is to inject one of the parent component
into the child component constructor.

| ❌ | Not widely used in real-world applications                                                                                                                                ||
| ❌ | Makes components tightly coupled                                                                                                                                          |
| ❌ | Only allow communication one-way, from parent to child                                                                                                                    |
| ❌ | Can only inject components that are part of the direct parent hierarchy                                                                                                   |
| ✅ | For very specific cases, this technique can simplify communication between tightly related components by eliminating the need for intermediate services or event emitters |
| ✅ | Allow a child component to call methods or access properties directly from the parent component                                                                           |


```typescript
// parent component
@Component({
  template: `<app-child-component/>`,
})
class ParentComponent {
  foo() {
    alert('bar');
  }
}

// child component
class ChildComponent {
  constructor(private parentComponent: ParentComponent) {
    this.parentComponent.foo(); // <- calling foo method from child component
  }
}
```
