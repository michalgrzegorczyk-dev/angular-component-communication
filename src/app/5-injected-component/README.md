## Injected Components in Angular

<img src="/public/img/img5.png" alt="Inputs and Outputs" style="width: 500px; height:auto;">


Let's explore an interesting but rarely-used technique of component injection! 
This approach lets a child component directly access its parent by injecting the 
parent component into the child's constructor. While not common, it's worth understanding 
for specific use cases.

#### üí° Practical Uses of Injected Components
1. Complex form components where child fields need parent form context.
2. Nested menu structures where child items need parent menu state.
3. Wizard/stepper components where steps need access to the main wizard state.

| ‚ùå | Rare in real-world applications, which may make the code less maintainable for teams.                                                                                                 |
| ‚ùå | Creates strong dependencies between components, reducing reusability.                                                                                                                                        |
| ‚ùå | Limited to one-way communication from child to parent.                                                                                                  |
| ‚ùå | Only works with direct parent components in the hierarchy.                                                                                                 |
| ‚úÖ | Simplifies parent-child communication in specific cases without extra services. |
| ‚úÖ | Provides direct access to parent methods and properties from the child component.                                                                           |


```typescript
// Parent component that child can access.
@Component()
class ParentComponent {
  foo() {
    alert('bar');
  }
}

// Child component with injected parent.
class ChildComponent {
  constructor(private parentComponent: ParentComponent) {
    this.parentComponent.foo(); // Direct access to parent's methods.
  }
}
```
