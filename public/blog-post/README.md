# Mastering Component Communication in Angular

## Introduction

When building applications with Angular, it's important to know how 
different parts of your app can share information. This is called 
component communication, and today I'll cover all possible 
ways to make components talk to each other and also points
out the ones that are not typically considered as component
communication, but can actually help to share information.

### Here's the list of topics that will be covered:

- Approaches frequently used, and recommended
  - `@Input` and `@Output`
  - Setter methods
  - `OnChanges` lifecycle hook
  - Services
  - `@ViewChild` and `@ViewChildren`
  - Routing Params and Queries
  - Template reference variables
  - Injecting parent components into child components
  - `@Input` and `@Output` inheritance
- Modern approaches, Angular V17+
  - `input()` and `output()`
  - `viewChild()` and `viewChildren()`
  - `withComponentInputBinding()`
- Approaches not considered as component communication
  - Component projection, `<ng-content>`, `*ngTemplateOutlet`, etc.
  - Using `@ContentChild` and `@ContentChildren`
  - Passing data via router resolvers
  - Using `@HostListener` and `@HostBinding`
  - WebAPI, like `localStorage`, `broadcastChannel`, etc.

It's worth to remember that some of these approaches are better than 
others in specific cases, but for sure it's good to know all of them. 
This way, you can pick the best one for your case. <u>The key here is a 
critical thinking and understanding context of the problem.</u>

Every approach will be explained in detail, with
[code examples](https://github.com/michalgrzegorczyk-dev/angular-component-communication)
that you can run and test by yourself. FYI, code examples in the blog post will be simplified, 
so I really recommend you to check the full examples in the repository.

## Inputs & Outputs, Setters and OnChanges

<img src="/public/img/input.png" alt="x" style="width: 500px; height:auto;">

### 1. Inputs & Outputs

The most fundamental way of enabling communication between components
in Angular is through the use of <b>Input</b> and <b>Output</b> functionality.
It can be achieved in many ways, old and new, most common and less known, 
directly and indirectly. All scenarios will be covered but for now let's start 
with the basics.

#### Traditional & Non-traditional Approach 

The traditional approach involves using `@Input()` and `@Output()` 
decorators that allows a child components to receive passed data and enables
child components to send data back to its parents. This approach has been 
a used in Angular development for years and is the most basic way to 
communicate between components.

```typescript
@Component()
class Component {
  thisIsInputProperty = '';
  thisIsOutputProperty = new EventEmitter<string>();
} 
```

Actually, we don't need decorators for inputs and outputs, did you know it?
We can use `@Component` metadata `inputs` or `outputs` arrays and pass 
the names of variables that we want to work as inputs or outputs. It 
will work the same way as using decorators.

| Status | Description                                                                                                                          |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚ùå | Approach with providing inputs and outputs via metadata properties can be harder to understand for not experienced Angular Developers ||
| ‚úÖ | Most common way to communicate between components                                                                                    |
| ‚úÖ | In newest version of Angular, you can transform data as well in inline @Input decorators                                             | |
| ‚úÖ | Always good to use                                                                                                                   | |


```typescript
@Component({
  inputs: ['thisIsInputProperty'],
  outputs: ['thisIsOutputProperty']
})
class Component {
  thisIsInputProperty: string;
  thisIsOutputProperty = new EventEmitter<string>();
} 
```
#### 2. Modern Approach with Signals

With newer versions of Angular, we can now use signals with the `input()`
and `output()` functions instead of decorators. There is no difference
in passing the data except that we don't need to use decorators and 
now we're working with signals.


| Status | Description                            |
|--------|----------------------------------------|
| ‚ùå | Doesnt work with component inheritance ||
| ‚úÖ | Except above, always good to use       | |


```typescript
@Component()
class Component {
  thisIsInputProperty = input<string>();
  thisIsOutputProperty = output<string>();
} 
```

#### Setter Methods

Angular provides an additional layer of control over inputs through 
setter methods. These setters are called whenever the input value 
changes, allowing you to:


| Status | Description                                               |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚ùå | Need to create aditional property to show value           |
| ‚ùå | More code, than inline @Input                             |
| ‚úÖ | Perform advanced validation                               |
| ‚úÖ | Transform the incoming data                               |
| ‚úÖ | Trigger side effects                                      |

```typescript
@Input()
set name(value: string) {
  console.log('New name:', value);
  this._name = value.trim();
}
```

#### Input Inheritance

In the traditional approach, there's an interesting technique for 
inheriting input and output properties from a parent component. 
While not commonly used it's always good to know more than less.
Also, it's important to note that this inheritance method is not compatible 
with the signals approach.

| Status | Description                                           |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚ùå | Component inheritance is rarely used in Angular       |
| ‚ùå | This approach is not compatible with the signals approach |
| ‚úÖ | Good to know more than less                           |

```typescript
// parent component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
})
export class ChildComponent extends ParentComponent {
  @Input()
  parentInput: string;
}

// child component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  inputs: ['parentInput']
})
export class ChildComponent extends ParentComponent {
  // The child now has access to 'parentInput'
}
```

Full set of examples around this topic you can find in the [1-input-output](https://github.com/michalgrzegorczyk-dev/angular-component-communication/tree/master/src/app/1-input-output) folder.


### 2. `ngOnChanges` Lifecycle Hook

Angular offers another way to handle input changes: the `ngOnChanges` 
lifecycle hook. This method runs when a component's input 
properties change. It's similar to input setter methods but more powerful.

| Status | Description                                                                 |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚ùå | Runs for every input change, which may impact performance if overused.      |
| ‚ùå | Triggers for any input change, even if you only care about specific inputs. |
| ‚ùå | Need to hold additional property to show it on the view                     |
| ‚úÖ | It can handle multiple inputs at once                                       |
| ‚úÖ | It lets you check if it's the first change                                  | |
| ‚úÖ | You can compare new and old values.                                         | |

```typescript
@Component()
class Component implements OnChanges {
  input1 = input('initial');
  value = signal('');

  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
    if (changes['input1'].isFirstChange()) {
      console.log(changes['input1'].currentValue);
    } else {
      console.log(changes['input1'].previousValue);
      console.log(changes['input1'].currentValue);
      this.value.set(changes['input1'].currentValue);
    }
  }
}
```

Full set of examples around this topic you can find in the [2-input-ng-on-changes](https://github.com/michalgrzegorczyk-dev/angular-component-communication/tree/master/src/app/2-input-ng-on-changes) folder.


### 3. Services

<img src="/public/img/services.png" alt="x" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">

Services in Angular provide a powerful way to share data and 
functionality across components. They represent the third major approach 
of component communication, alongside inputs/outputs and the `ngOnChanges` 
lifecycle hook.

While services can be a complex topic, we'll focus on the 
most common and straightforward approach, which is providing a service at 
the root level and focus on how we can communicate between components.

| Status | Description                                                            |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚ùå | Requires understanding of dependency injection and (often) observables |
| ‚ùå | Can introduce additional complexity for simple applications            |
| ‚úÖ | Allow components to communicate without direct dependencies            |
| ‚úÖ | Can be used across multiple components                                 |


```typescript
// service
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
class NewService {
  value = signal('initial');

  setValue(value: string) {
    this.value.set(value);
  }
}

// component
class ServiceComponent {
  service = inject(NewService);
  valueFromService = this.service.value;
  
  setValue(value: string) {
    this.service.setValue(value);
  }
}
```

Full set of examples around this topic you can find in the [3-service](https://github.com/michalgrzegorczyk-dev/angular-component-communication/tree/master/src/app/3-service) folder.


### 4. Template Variables

<img src="/public/img/template.png" alt="x" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">

Template variables are a powerful feature in Angular that let parent and child 
components communicate directly through the template by using special sign `#`. 
They allow to reference elements or components within the template,
making it easier to create dynamic and interactive interactions between components. 


| Status | Description                                                           |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚ùå | Not scalable, creates tightly coupled components                      |
| ‚ùå | Only accessible within the template                                   |
| ‚ùå | Only allow communication one-way, from parent to child                |
| ‚úÖ | Simple and direct access                                              |
| ‚úÖ | No need for extra code for inputs, outputs or services to communicate |
| ‚úÖ | Parent can call child methods                                         |



```typescript
// child component
class TodoListComponent {
  todos = ['Learn Angular', 'Build an app'];

  addTodo() {
    this.todos.push(`New Todo ${this.todos.length + 1}`);
  }
}

// parent component
@Component({
  template: `
    <todo-list #todoList/>
    <button (click)="addTodo(todoList)">Add Todo</button>
  `,
  imports: [TodoListComponent]
})
class TodoListComponent {
  addTodo(todoList: TodoListComponent) {
    todoList.addTodo();
  }
}
```

Full set of examples around this topic you can find in the [4-template-variable](https://github.com/michalgrzegorczyk-dev/angular-component-communication/tree/master/src/app/4-template-variable) folder.


### 5. Injected Components

<img src="/public/img/injected-components.png" alt="x" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">

Injecting components is rarely used technique and personally, I haven't
seen that, but it's great discover to elaborate. It allows a child component to 
access its parent component directly. This method provides a way to 
establish communication between components in a parent-child 
relationship. What you need to do is to inject one of the parent component
into the child component constructor.


| Status | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚ùå | Not widely used in real-world applications                                                                                                                                ||
| ‚ùå | Makes components tightly coupled                                                                                                                                          |
| ‚ùå | Only allow communication one-way, from parent to child                                                                                                                    |
| ‚ùå | Can only inject components that are part of the direct parent hierarchy                                                                                                   |
| ‚úÖ | For very specific cases, this technique can simplify communication between tightly related components by eliminating the need for intermediate services or event emitters |
| ‚úÖ | Allow a child component to call methods or access properties directly from the parent component                                                                           |


```typescript
// parent component
@Component({
  template: `<app-child-component/>`,
})
class ParentComponent {
  foo() {
    alert('bar');
  }
}

// child component
class ChildComponent {
  constructor(private parentComponent: ParentComponent) {
    this.parentComponent.foo(); // <- calling foo method from child component
  }
}
```

## ViewChild and ViewChildren
<img src="/public/img/view-child.png" alt="x" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">

### View Child
`@ViewChild` is a powerful decorator in Angular that allows a parent component 
to access and interact with its child components directly. This technique 
provides a way to establish communication between components in a 
parent-child relationship through the template. 

#### 1. Traditional Approach
The traditional method involves using `@ViewChild()` decorator as described above.

#### 2. Modern Approach with Signals
In Angular v17+, there is a
new way to use ViewChild feature, with signals `viewChild()`.

#### How ViewChild Works

- The parent component uses the `@ViewChild` decorator to query its 
template for a child component.
- The query can be based on the child component's class or a template reference variable.
- Once the view is initialized (in the ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hook), Angular assigns the 
child component instance to a property in the parent.
- The parent can then access public properties and methods of the child component.
// todo do we need #?

Let's take a look at the code example:

```typescript
// parent component
@Component({
  template: `
    <app-child #viewChildChildComponent/>
    <button (click)="click()">Call Child Method</button>
  `,
  imports: [ChildComponent]
})
class ParentComponent {
  // old way of using ViewChild
  @ViewChild(ChildComponent)
  childComponentOld!: ChildComponent;

  // new way with signals of using ViewChild
  childComponentNew = viewChild.required<ViewChildChildComponent>('viewChildChildComponent');

  click() {
    this.childComponentOld.foo();
    this.childComponentNew().foo();
  }
}

// child component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-6-child',
})
class ChildComponent {
  foo() {
    console.log('bar');
  }
}
```

Full set of examples you can find in the [src/app/6-view-child](src/app/6-view-child) folder.


### View Children
The `@ViewChildren` decorator in Angular is a powerful tool that allows a 
parent component to query and interact with multiple child components or 
elements in its template. It's similar to `@ViewChild`, but it returns a 
`QueryList` of elements or components instead of a single instance.

#### 1. Traditional Approach
The traditional method involves using `@ViewChildren()` decorator as 
described above.

#### 2. Modern Approach with Signals
Similar to `@ViewChild`, in Angular v17+ there is a new way to use 
`@ViewChildren` feature, with signal approach `viewChildren()`.

Let's take a look at the code example: 

```typescript
// parent component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  template: `
    @for (val of [1, 2, 3]; track $index) {
      <app-7-child/>
    }
    <button (click)="click()">Call Child Methods</button>
  `,
  imports: [ChildComponent]
})
export class ParentComponent {
  // old way of using ViewChildren
  @ViewChildren(ChildComponent) children!: QueryList<ChildComponent>;

  // new way with signals of using ViewChildren
  childrenNew = viewChildren<ChildComponent>(ChildComponent);

  click() {
    this.children.forEach(child => child.foo());
    this.childrenNew().forEach(child => child.foo());
  }
}

// child component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<h2>app-child</h2>`,
})
export class ChildComponent {
  foo() {
    console.log('bar');
  }
}
```

Full set of examples you can find in the [src/app/7-view-children](src/app/7-view-children) folder.


## Routing Params & Queries

<img src="/public/img/router.png" alt="x" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">

### Routing Parameters

Routing parameters provide a powerful way to pass data between components in 
Angular applications. This method is particularly useful when you need to 
share information across different views or components that are not 
directly related in the component tree.

#### How Routing Parameters Work
1. Parameters are defined in the route configuration and routes should be passed 
to `provideRouter(routes)` function.
2. When navigating to a route, you can pass values for these parameters.
3. The component associated with the route can then access these parameters.

To use routing parameters, you need to set up your routing configuration and 
implement the necessary components. Let's see how this works in practice.

```typescript
// app.config.ts
const routes = [
  {path: 'details/:id', component: RoutingParamChildComponent},
];

const appConfig = {
  providers: [provideRouter(routes)]
};

// parent component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  template: `<router-outlet/>`,
  imports: [RouterOutlet]
})
class RoutingParamParentComponent {
  router = inject(Router);

  goToDetails() {
    this.router.navigate(['/details', '123']);
  }
}

// child component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `{{ id() }}`,
})
class ChildComponent implements OnInit {
  id = signal('foo');
  activatedRoute = inject(ActivatedRoute);

  ngOnInit() {
    this.activatedRoute.params.subscribe(params => {
      this.id.set(params['id']); // <- '123'
    });
  }
}
```

Full set of examples you can find in the [src/app/8-routing-param](src/app/8-routing-param) folder.




### Routing Queries 

Routing queries provide a flexible way to pass optional data between
components in Angular applications. Unlike route parameters, which are part of
the route path, query parameters are appended to the URL after a question
mark (?) and are typically used for optional information such as sorting, 
filtering, or pagination.

#### How Routing Query Parameters Work
1. Query parameters are added to the URL after the route path.
2. They can be added, modified, or removed without changing the route.
3. Components can read these parameters to adjust their behavior or display.

#### Key Differences from Route Parameters

1. URL Structure:
   - Route params: /details/123
   - Query params: /details?id=123&sort=name&order=asc

2. Usage: Query params are ideal for optional, changeable data that doesn't define the route.
3. Multiple Values: You can easily pass multiple key-value pairs in query params.

Having some knowledge from previous examples, let's see how routing query:

```typescript
// parent component
goToDetails() {
  this.router.navigate(['/detail-query'], {
    queryParams: {
      id: '123',
      name: 'John Doe',
      role: 'Developer'
    }
  });
}


// child component
route = inject(ActivatedRoute);

ngOnInit() {
  this.route.queryParams.subscribe((params: Params) => {
    this.id = params['id'];
    this.name = params['name'];
    this.role = params['role'];
  });
}
```

Full set of examples you can find in the [src/app/9-routing-query](src/app/9-routing-query) folder.

## When it can feel like communication

### `@ContentChild` and `@ContentChildren`
While `@ContentChild` involves interaction with projected content, it's 
not traditionally considered component communication in the same way as 
`@ViewChild`. In `@ViewChild`, there‚Äôs a direct line between the parent and 
child components for controlling behavior, but `@ContentChild` is more about 
a child adapting to or interacting with content passed down from the parent, 
typically through `<ng-content>`.

### `*ngTemplateOutlet`
I wouldn't consider using `*ngTemplateOutlet` as traditional component 
communication because it's more about template projection and dynamic 
rendering than direct interaction between components. However, it does 
involve data passing between the parent and the dynamically rendered 
template, which can be seen as a form of indirect communication.

## Outro
That's it, we  finally reached to the end of the blog post. I covered all the 
ways of component communication in Angular, showed cases for old syntax and
most recent with usage of signals. I really hope you enjoyed reading it.
