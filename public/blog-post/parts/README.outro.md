## Outro
That's it, you finally reached to the end of the blog post. We've covered all the ways of 
component communication in Angular, showed cases for old syntax and most 
recent with usage of signals. I showed component communication in different 
variants, direct, indirect, commonly used and less known techniques.

I hope you found this guide helpful!  Feel free to leave a comment below with any questions, or if you 
encounter any problems, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/michalgrzegorczyk-dev/angular-component-communication/issues/new).

All the examples are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/michalgrzegorczyk-dev/angular-component-communication/tree/master/src/app).

Thanks for reading! üôè
